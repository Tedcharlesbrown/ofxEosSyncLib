Conversion of EosSyncLib open source library to OpenFrameworks Library

This is 100% not up and running. I do not know how to actually make an addon for OpenFrameworks. If anyone is interested in helping me out a little - I would greatly appreciate it.

OpenFrameworks addon template: https://github.com/openframeworks/ofxAddonTemplate/
