Conversion of EosSyncLib open source library to OpenFrameworks Library

This is 100% not up and running. I do not know how to actually make an addon for OpenFrameworks. If anyone is interested in helping me out a little - I would greatly appreciate it.

Link to EosSyncLib library: https://github.com/ETCLabs/EosSyncLib

OpenFrameworks addon template: https://github.com/openframeworks/ofxAddonTemplate/

I am also interested in this C library from Figure53. Although I know C way less than C++, it looks promising for OSC via TCP: https://github.com/Figure53/F53OSC
